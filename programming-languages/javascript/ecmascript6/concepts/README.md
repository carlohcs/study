# Understanding ECMAScript 6

These studies are based in [https://github.com/nzakas/understandinges6](https://github.com/nzakas/understandinges6).

## Overview

**[Chapter 1: Block Bindings](./chapters/Chapter-1-Block-Bindings.md)** talks about `let` and `const`, the block-level replacement for `var`.

**[Chapter 2: Strings and Regular Expressions](./chapters/Chapter-2-Strings-and-Regular-Expressions.md)** covers the additions to string manipulation and inspection as well as the introduction of template strings.

**[Chapter 3: Functions](./chapters/Chapter-3-Functions.md)** discusses the various changes to functions. This includes the arrow function form, default parameters, rest parameters, and more.

**Chapter 4: Objects** explains the changes to how objects are created, modified, and used. Topics include changes to object literal syntax, and new reflection methods.

**Chapter 5: Destructuring** introduces object and array destructuring, which allow you to decompose objects and arrays using a concise syntax.

**Chapter 6: Symbols** introduces the concept of symbols, a new way to define properties. Symbols are a new primitive type that can be used to obscure (but not hide) object properties and methods.

**Chapter 7: Sets and Maps** details the new collection types of `Set`, `WeakSet`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`. These types expand on the usefulness of arrays by adding semantics, de-duping, and memory management designed specifically for JavaScript.

**Chapter 8: Iterators and Generators** discusses the addition of iterators and generators to the language. These features allow you to work with collections of data in powerful ways that were not possible in previous versions of JavaScript.

**Chapter 9: Classes** introduces the first formal concept of classes in JavaScript. Often a point of confusion for those coming from other languages, the addition of class syntax in JavaScript makes the language more approachable to others and more concise for enthusiasts.

**Chapter 10: Arrays** details the changes to native arrays and the interesting new ways they can be used in JavaScript.

**Chapter 11: Promises** introduces promises as a new part of the language. Promises were a grassroots effort that eventually took off and gained in popularity due to extensive library support. ECMAScript 6 formalizes promises and makes them available by default.

**Chapter 12: Reflection** introduces the formalized reflection API for JavaScript. Similar to other languages, ECMAScript 6 reflection allows you to inspect objects at a granular level, even if you didn't create the object.

**Chapter 13: Proxies** discusses the new proxy object that allows you to intercept every operation performed on an object. Proxies give developers unprecedented control over objects and, as such, unlimited possibilities for defining new interaction patterns.

**Chapter 14: Modules** details the official module format for JavaScript. The intent is that these modules can replace the numerous ad-hoc module definition formats that have appeared over the years.
