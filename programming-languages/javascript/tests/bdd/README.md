# BDD - Behavior-driven Development

> BDD emphasises shared language amongst developers and stakeholders. The ethos of BDD, and the way that specs are written in RSpec encourage developers to focus on testing the external behaviour of their code, rather than its internal details, with specs that are couched in terms of this shared language. This encourages the developer to always consider the beneficial value of the feature being developed, and focus on delivering it.
