## Exercise 1: Todos - Your First Backbone.js App

Building a todo list is a great way to learn Backbone's convetions. It's a relatively simple application, yet techinical challenges surrounding binding, persisting model data, routing, and template rendering provide opportunities to illustrate some core Backbone features.

Let's consider the application's architecture at a high level. We'll need:

* A Todo model to describe individual todo items
* A TodoList Collection to store and persist todos
* A way of creating todos
* A way to display a listing of todos
* A way to edit existing todos
* A way to mark a todo as completed
* A way to delete todos
* A way to filter the items that have complete or are remaining

**Essentially, these features are classic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods. Let's get started!**
